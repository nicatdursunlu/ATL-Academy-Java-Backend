Tasks - SQL-Part_2

1.	Write query to display count of each age in a table;
___________________
|age| count_of_age |
|23 |      3       |
|33 |	   4       |
|44 |      6       |

2.	First of all you need to create two tables :
a.	Loans -> {id, customer_id, loan}
b.	Limits -> {id, customer_id, limit}
Write a query to display the percent of limit which is used by each customer:
e.g.: if customer_id = 123
has a loan = 50 AZN; and has a limit = 100 AZN then the customer(123) is used 50 % percent of the limit,
so the result must be like: 50%.
